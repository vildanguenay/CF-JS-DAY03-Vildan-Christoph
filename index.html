<!--Basic Exercise 1 | Temperature v1.0
Create a program that according to the temperature will provide you with the information, whether the weather is cold or moderate. This program should generate a different random number every time, that should be between -5c and 25c. If the temperature is between -5c and 10c print "The weather is cold" otherwise print "The weather is moderate".

<script>
		var min = -5;
		var max = 25;
		var random = Math.floor(Math.random()* (+max - +min) + +min);
		document.write(random);

		function temperature(){
			if (random > 10) {
				document.write("The weather is moderate");
				}

			else {
				document.write("The weather is cold");
			}

			
		}

temperature(random)
